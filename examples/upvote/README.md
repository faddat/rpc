# Upvote

Simply upvote whatever you like.

## Usage

Create a file called `wif.txt` in the current working directory
and place the WIF to be used to sign the transaction.

Now you can do the voting part using voter `me`, author `someauthor`
and permlink `somepermlink`:

```bash
$ ./upvote me somebody somepermlink
```
